# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

This build's purpose is to make a random password that wouldn't be so easily guessed and could be used for anything as important as work or as simple as a personal email. Including criteria that is commonly used in password requirements, you are able to pick and choose what you want to make up your password. Now when there are password breaches anywhere you can quickly change it to something that you know will be more secure. During this project I suprisingly learned a lot about how css properties worked together and how a modal is a very effective way of presenting options to the user.


## User Story

```
AS A user 
I WANT to make a randomly generated password with different requirements
SO THAT I can have a password for any type of use and they won't be the same
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I want a new password
WHEN I click the criteria button
THEN I am presented with a selection of options to check from
WHEN deciding on the length of the password
THEN I can choose between 4 and 8 characters
WHEN asked for letters, numbers, and/or symbols
THEN I can choose which of those I want to makeup the password
WHEN I am satisfied with my criteria requirements
THEN I select the generate button
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password shows up in the result container
WHEN the password is in the result container
THEN I can use the copy to clipboard button for easy copy/pasting
```
